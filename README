Net-FSP

FSP is a very lightweight UDP based protocol for transferring files. FSP has
many benefits over FTP, mainly for running anonymous archives. FSP protocol is
valuable in all kinds of environments because it is one of the few protocols
that is not aggressive about bandwidth while at the same time being
sufficiently fault tolerant. Net::FSP is a class implementing the client side of
FSP.
