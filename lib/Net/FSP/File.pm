=over 4

=item download($sink = $self->name)

This method downloads the file to C<$sink>. C<$sink> must either be an
untainted filename, a filehandle or a callback function.

=item grab($sink = $self->name)

This method downloads the file and deletes it at when this is done.
These actions are considered atomic by the server. Its argument works as in
C<download>.

=item cat()

This method downloads the file and returns it as a string. Using this on large
files is not recommended.

=item upload($source)

This method overwrites a file on the server. C<$source> must either be a
filename, a filehandle or a callback function.

=item open($mode)

Open a file and return a filehandle. I<$mode> must be either B<E<lt>> or
B<E<gt>> for reading or writing respectively. Only one writing filehandle at a
time may be opened, this is a protocol restriction.
